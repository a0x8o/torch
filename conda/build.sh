#
# $ cd <path to caffe2, e.g. ~/caffe2>
# $ conda build conda/build
#
# This installation uses MKL and does not use CUDA
#
# If you're debugging this, it may be useful to use the env that conda build is
# using:
# $ cd <anaconda_root>/conda-bld/caffe2_<timestamp>
# $ source activate _h_env_... # some long path with lots of placeholders
#
# Also, failed builds will accumulate those caffe2_<timestamp> directories. You
# can remove them after a succesfull build with
# $ conda build purge
