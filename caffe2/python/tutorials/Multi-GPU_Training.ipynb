    "# Multi-GPU Training with Caffe2 \n",
    "\n",
    "![caffe2 imagenet logo](images/imagenet-caffe2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we will explore multi-GPU training. We will show you a basic structure for using the `data_parallel_model` to quickly process a subset of the ImageNet database along the same design as the [ResNet-50 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). We will also get a chance to look under the hood at a few of Caffe2's C++ operators that efficiently handle your image pipeline, build a ResNet model, train on a single GPU and show some optimizations that are included with `data_parallel_model`, and finally we'll scale it up and show you how to parallelize your model so you can run it on multiple GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly used dataset for benchmarking image recognition technologies is [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/). It is huge. It has images that cover the gamut, and they're categorized by labels so that you can create image subsets of animals, plants, fungi, people, objects, you name it. It's the focus of yearly competitions and this is where deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN) really made its name. During the 2012 ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge a CNN demonstrated accuracy more than 10% beyond the next competing method. Going from around 75% accuracy to around 85% accuracy when every year the gains were only a percent or two is a significant accomplishment. \n",
    "\n",
    "![imagenet montage](images/imagenet-montage.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's play with ImageNet and train our own model on a bunch of GPUs! You're going to need a lot space to host the 14 million images in ImageNet. How much disk space do you have? You should clear up about 300GB of space... on SSD. Spinning discs are so 2000. How much time do you have? With two GPUs maybe we'll be done in just under a week. Ready?\n",
    "\n",
    "![one does not simply train imagenet in a minute](images/imagenet-meme.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "That's way too much space and way too long for a tutorial! If you happened to have that much space and 128 GPUs on the latest NVIDIA V100's then you're super awesome and you can replicate our recent results shown below. You might even be able to train ImageNet in under an hour. Given how this performance seems to scale, **maybe YOU can train ImageNet in a minute!** Think about all of the things you could accomplish... a model for millions of hours of video? Catalogue every cat video on YouTube? Look for your doppleganger on Imgur?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of tons of GPUs and the full set of data, we're going to do this cooking show style. We're going to use a small batch images to train on, and show how you can scale that up. We chose a small slice of ImageNet: a set of 640 cars and 640 boats for our training set. We have 48 cars and 48 boats for our test set. This makes our database of images around 130 MB.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ResNet-50 Model Training Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an overview of what is needed to train and test this model across multiple GPUs. You see that it is generally not that long, nor is it that complicated. Some of the interactions for creating the parallelized model are handled by custom functions you have to write and we'll go over those later.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. use `brew` to create a model for training (we'll create one for testing later)\n",
    "2. create a database reader using the model helper object's `CreateDB` to pull the images\n",
    "3. create functions to run a ResNet-50 model for one or more GPUs\n",
    "3. create the parallelized model\n",
    "4. loop through the number of epochs you want to run, then for each epoch\n",
    "    * run the train model till you finish each batch of images\n",
    "    * run the test model\n",
    "    * calculate times, accuracies, and display the results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first assignment is to get your training and testing image database setup. We've created one for you and all you have to do run the code block below. This assumes you know how to use IPython. When we say run a code block, you can click the block and hit the Play button above or hit Ctrl-Enter on your keyboard. If this is news to you it is advisable that you start with introductory tutorials and get used to IPython and Caffe2 basics first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will download a small database of boats and cars images and their labels for you if it doesn't already exist. The images were pulled from ImageNet and added to a `lmdb` format database. You can download it directly [here](https://download.caffe2.ai/databases/resnet_trainer.zip) unzip it, and change the folder locations to an NFS if that better suits your situation. The tutorial's default location is for you to place it in `~/caffe2_notebooks/tutorial_data/resnet_trainer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also swap out the database with your own as long as it is in lmdb and you change the `train_data_count` and `test_data_count` variables below. For your first time just use that database we made for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to give you all the dependencies needed for the tutorial in the block below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task: Run the Setup Code\n",
    "Read and then run the code block below. Note what modules are being imported and where we're accessing the database. Note and troubleshoot any errors in case something is wrong with your environment. Don't worry about the `nccl` and `gloo` warning messages.\n"

    "\n",
    "Caffe2 comes with `ModelHelper` which will do a lot of the heavy lifting for you when setting up a model. Throughout the docs and tutorial this may also be called a `model helper object`. The only required parameter is `name`. It is an arbitrary name for referencing the network in your workspace: you could call it tacos or boatzncarz. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "taco_model = model_helper.ModelHelper(name=\"tacos\")\n",

    "\n",
    "### Reading from the Database\n",

Also, while you do this, experiment with IPython's development hooks by typing the first part of the name from the imported class or module and hitting the tab key. For example when creating the object you type: `train_model = model_helper.` and after the dot, hit \"tab\". You should see a full list of available functions. Then when you choose `ModelHelper` hit \"(\" then hit tab and you should see a full list of params. This is very handy when you're exploring new modules and their functions!\n",

Since images that are found in the wild can be wildly different sizes, aspect ratios, and orientations we can and should train on as much variety as we can. ImageNet is no exception here. The average resolution is 496x387, and as interesting as that factoid might be, the bottle line is that you have a lot of variation. \n",

We talked about the drawbacks of doing this in [Image Pre-Processing](Image_Pre-Processing_Pipeline.ipynb). Therefore for more accurate results, we should probably rescale, then crop. Even this approach with cropping has the drawbacks of losing some info from the original photo. What get chopped off doesn't make into the training data. If you ran the pre-processing tutorial on the image of the astronauts you will recall that some of the astronauts didn't make the cut. Where'd they go? Wash-out lane? Planet of the Apes? If your model was to detect people, then those lost astronauts would not be getting due credit when you run inference or face detection later using the model.\n",

You can crop randomly around the image to create many deriviates of the original image, boosting your training data set, thereby adding robustness to the model.

In the image below only the front a boat is shown and the model shows a 50% confidence in detection.\n",
